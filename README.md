# Data-Sentiment-Analysis

This project is a demo to a Phd Sentiment Analysis project. Customer feedback data on sustainable products was extracted from the Internet 
(including company websites through their provided APIs) and then filtered and stored such as in 'Product1.xlsx'. Then the python script 'Analysis.ipynb'
applies sentiment analyzer and emotion detection on the data to generate graphs with varying compund scores and emotions. The script was made by using
Seaborn, Matplotlib, Natural Langauge toolkit (nltk), SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, Hugging Face Transformers.
